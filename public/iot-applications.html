        <h2>What are IoT Applications?</h2>

     
          <div>
        <p> An IoT Application is the integration of internet 
            access with everyday artefacts.

        It mainly envolves connecting the device through internet
        and analysing and using that data for safety and sustainability.</p>
            
        <p>Also, know as Cyber-Physical Sytems in Europe.

        Its various forms can be seen as wearables, smart cities/building/energy, etc.
        </p>

      </div>

        <h2>Smart building scenario</h2>
        <p> A smart building can be an automated system that can respond and take response intelligently.

        In such a building various functionalities of the building are fulfilled entirely through internet access hence a seamless connection is required.

        Popular concepts of temperature/climate control and sustainable energy coonsumption are encooperated in smart buildings like smart homes. Facility management and monitorig to provide remote access and fulfill needs. 
        Otherwise smart hospitals and smart petrol/charding stations are other examples in this field.
        </p>

        <h2>Control Interface of Smart building IoT application</h2>
        <p> Apart from being about and almost automated, with minimal
             human interaction the entire CPS interacted with the user, 
            that can be its visitors, residents,
             utility providers or other beneficiaries.  
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>IoT applications</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Smart building: HVAC automated hospitals/ hotels, Sustainable Power plants </li>
            <li> Wearables : Smart watches, Smart glasses, headsets</li>
            <li> Smart monitoring: Baby monitoring, pet shelther, prison managemnt</li>
          </ul>
